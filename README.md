## Mobile Flashcards

This is the source code for a cross-platform mobile flashcards app. Although this app has been implemented to work on both Android and iOS, it has been tested on Android only.

To work on or run the app on your phone / emulator, follow below steps:
* In a terminal window 'cd' into this dir
* Install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`
* Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
* Follow instructions that appear on the terminal to run this app on the emulator or Expo app on your phone.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
